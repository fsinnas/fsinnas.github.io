			<h4>What is GIS?</h4>
		</center>
		<p>
			GIS or Geographic information systems is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage and
			present spatial or geographic data. Essential, there are hundreds of tools that allow users to create
			interactive
			queries to analyze spatial information and editing producing data on maps while producing new results of
			these
			operations(Clarke K.C, 1986). GIS can refer to various different processes, techniques and methods depending
			what
			you use for to engineering, planning, management, transport/ logistics and telecommunications (Maliene V,
			Grigonis
			V, Palevičius V, Griffiths S, 2011). GIS use is very flexible and that sounds all fine but, how does hold up
			in
			relations to homeland security concerning national disasters to earthquakes, hurricanes and flooding.
			Apparently
			that answer is in good faith because GIS provides tools for Risk Assessment and Planning, Preparedness,
			Mitigation, Response, Recovery in accordance to these natural disasters.
		</p>
		<h4>Active risk assessment and planning </h4>
		<p>GIS helps provides active risk assessment and planning for the possibility of natural disasters with the
			potential consequences or impacts on life, property and the environment. This includes assessing the
			hazards, risks and probability as a determination of mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery needs.
			For example, GIS in conjunction with remote sensing and photogrammetry can be used to identify hazards like
			seismic faults, flood prone areas can be identified by the scientist using GIS to analyze satellite image
			with aerial photos with file survey data (Lavakare, A. ,2010). Once the hazards have been identified their
			representation can be stored within a GIS databases. The information required for earthquake risk assessment
			that includes various locations and properties of nearby seismic faults, surface geology, terrain slope,
			water table levels and inventories of epicentres and landslide occurrences. Even in hurricanes GIS can store
			information for land use, land cover, coastline and distance from coast with similarly topology data is
			required for flood assessment and storm surge analysis. Once all of the pieces are aligned and set then the
			system can create new a hazard layer with meaningful data for hazards. Inventory data can be aggregated into
			manageable geographic regions such as census wards, pin codes or larger administrative regions such for
			towns, villages with districts. This can be use with statistical functions available within the GIS systems
			to produce values that can be assigned to targets like a value of house within a flood plain. Once the
			information that has been retrieved from the quires then the information can be put into a risk assessment
			model that can run deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment. A deterministic risk assessment involves
			defining a disaster event and computing the damage that are associated with that event in contrast, a
			probabilistic risk assessment computes damage associated with different events that are also associated with
			the probability of it happening. In overall sense, GIS technology provides a powerful tool for showing
			outputs and allows users to physically see the area wide geographic distribution of the current and
			potential impacts from the multiple scenarios that will show areas that can be affected by the disaster.
		</p>
		<h4>Perparedness</h4>
		<p>Preparedness is the activities necessary to the extent that mitigation measures that have not, or cannot
			prevent disaster events. In most preparedness phases, governments to organizations, and individual develop
			plans to save lives while minimizing disaster damage like installing an early warning system for
			emergencies. Essentially, preparedness measures enhance response operations for agency to react in a timely
			fashion. So how GIS is used in Preparedness? GIS can help to provide the answer to several questions like
			“Where are additional Urban Search and Rescue teams necessary to improve response time and capability (ESRI,
			2001)?” “What evacuation routes should be selected if a toxic cloud or plume is accidentally or
			intentionally released from a known plant, storage facility, or terrorist device based on different wind
			patterns (ESRI, 2001)?” GIS can display the real time monitoring for emergency early warning. The system can
			hook up to remote weather systems can provide current weather indexes based on location and the local
			surrounding environment. The wind information such as wind direction, temperature, and relative humidity is
			important because this can possibly feeds in to a chemical release thereby creating problems with air
			quality and environmental health but,all of these factor can be displayed and mapped in real time. This
			information can be spread around in organizational information delivery which is very useful for
			preparedness (ESRI, 2001).
		</p>
		<h4>Migration</h4>
		<p>Mitigation is the activities that eliminate or reduce the probability of a disaster for example by having
			water sprinklers in building to prevent fires and spread around in a building. While long term activities
			such having a record of the MSDS for every building in a city can help reduce the effect of an unavoidable
			disaster. As potential emergencies are being identified the need for mitigation arises but more like
			mitigation analysis that examines potential human injuries and damages to buildings within the potentially
			affected area. GIS analysis can jump in easily and join structures, utilities, and affected population
			areas. The system can identify buildings that need repairs or relocation from ongoing dangers that require
			buffer zones to keep a safe distance from the source of danger. With GIS risk assessment can be setup really
			quickly to target the valuable resources that need protective action. For example, GIS can even identity
			local areas that could be thwarted by a flood zone by predicting the most likely scenario of where a flood
			can occur and map out the path of where the flood path would end up due to existing topographical features
			(ESRI, 2001).
		</p>
		<h4>Response</h4>
		<p>Response is where activities are able to provide to emergency assistance to people who are affected by the
			natural disasters and it the activities plan stabilize and grab hold of the situation to reduce any more
			damage can occur with a speedy recovery operation. Interesting enough GIS can provide one of the primary
			components of a computer- aided dispatch system that which select the quickest and closest emergency
			response units that can be tasked and routed to the emergency. The best part about the system is that it can
			provide detail information of what is known for that certain location even when the unit arrives there ,for
			example the existing floor plan for a building and any flammable materials that might burn within. Another
			option, that the GIS can run is a real time Advance Vehicle Locating feature where it can map and gather
			real time Global Positioning System data with transponders on the vehicle. With multiple emergencies on the
			rise GIS can display multiple positions on a real time map and assigned the responding units and personnel
			in an operations center (ESRI, 2001).
